# minimal-django-project
The shortest way to create Django project with a single file.....

The aim of this repository is to highlight the fact that a Django project, when simplified down to the bare essentials, can be nearly as minimal as a micro-framework application. 

### To run it:

1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/install/). If you have pip: `pip install Django`
4. Switch to the project directory: `cd minimal-django`
5. Run the development server: `python minimal.py runserver`
6. Open a browser to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`
